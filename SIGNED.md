#### Notes

With keybase you can sign any directory's contents, whether it's a git repo,
source code distribution, or a personal documents folder. It aims to replace the drudgery of:

  1. comparing a zipped file to a detached statement
  2. downloading a public key
  3. confirming it is in fact the author's by reviewing public statements they've made, using it

All in one simple command:

```bash
keybase dir verify
```

There are lots of options, including assertions for automating your checks.
